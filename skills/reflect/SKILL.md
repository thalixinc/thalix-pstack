description: Spawn three parallel review subagents over the active transcript, surface learnings, and route each to a concrete edit on an existing skill. Use when the user says reflect.

# Reflect

## External action boundary

Local, reversible work inside the user-scoped workspace may proceed when the request authorizes the task. Before sending any external message or performing any state-changing action in an external service, obtain explicit user authorization for that exact class of action. This includes posting comments, opening or merging pull requests, updating tickets, starting deployments or remote jobs, sending email or chat messages, and changing hosted settings. Read-only external inspection is allowed when needed. A general autonomy instruction does not replace this authorization.

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

## When to invoke

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## Process

### 1. Locate the active transcript

The parent locates the current thread through the host's thread or transcript API before fanning out. If the host provides a workspace-scoped local transcript path, use only that path. Never glob across unrelated project histories.

```bash
ls -t <agent-transcripts>/*.jsonl <agent-transcripts>/*/*.jsonl <agent-transcripts>/*/subagents/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

Three transcript layouts: legacy flat (`<id>.jsonl`), current nested (`<id>/<id>.jsonl`), and subagent (`<parent>/subagents/<child>.jsonl`).

For each candidate, read the first JSONL line and check that `message.content[0].text` contains the conversation's opening user prompt. Take the matching path. If no path resolves, write a tight digest of the session and pass that instead.

### 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

Launch three reviewers concurrently through the host's native agent interface. Give them the connector access required for cited tickets, chats, or observability traces, while keeping the review itself non-mutating. Inherit the parent model unless the host confirms another useful model is available.

| Lens | Prompt template |
|---|---|
| Judgment | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings through the host's agent-result channel.

### 3. Synthesize

Launch one synthesizer through the host's native agent interface. Give it connector access when citation checks require it, but keep the task non-mutating. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

### 4. Structural enforcement check

Sanity-check the synthesizer's Accepted list. For any item that would be enforced more reliably by a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check, move it from Accepted to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

### 5. Apply

Before applying any Accepted edit, present the synthesizer's full Accepted/Rejected/Backlog output to the user and wait for explicit approval. The user picks which subset to apply and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

Backlog items file to whatever devex / backlog tracker your team uses automatically. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

For each approved Accepted item, follow the Routing field exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): use the host's installed skill-authoring workflow and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but did not trigger when it should have): use the same skill-authoring workflow and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill: <kebab-name>`: use the host's skill-authoring workflow. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done. Skip this step if it doesn't.

### 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
