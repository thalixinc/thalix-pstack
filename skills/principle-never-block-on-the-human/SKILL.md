# Never Block on the Human

## External action boundary

Local, reversible work inside the user-scoped workspace may proceed when the request authorizes the task. Before sending any external message or performing any state-changing action in an external service, obtain explicit user authorization for that exact class of action. This includes posting comments, opening or merging pull requests, updating tickets, starting deployments or remote jobs, sending email or chat messages, and changing hosted settings. Read-only external inspection is allowed when needed. A general autonomy instruction does not replace this authorization.

The human supervises asynchronously. Agents must stay unblocked. Make reasonable decisions, proceed, and let the human course-correct after the fact.

**Why:** Every permission pause stalls the pipeline and makes the human the bottleneck. Since code changes are reversible and reviewable, a wrong decision usually costs less than blocking.

**Pattern:**
- **Proceed, then present.** Do the work, show the result. Don't ask "should I do X?" Do X, explain why.
- **Reserve questions for genuine ambiguity.** Ask only when you cannot infer intent from context.
- **Make the system self-healing.** When you notice a problem, log it and fix it in the next round.
- **Supervision is async.** Design workflows for review-after-the-fact.

**Boundaries:**
- **Any external message or state-changing external service action** still requires explicit user authorization for that class of action, even when reversible. This includes pushes, PR or ticket changes, remote jobs, deployments, and hosted settings. Irreversible local actions also require confirmation.
- **Reversible actions** (write code, edit notes, split tasks) should proceed without blocking.
- **Product direction** comes from the human. *Execution* should not block.
