# Swarm

## External action boundary

Local, reversible work inside the user-scoped workspace may proceed when the request authorizes the task. Before sending any external message or performing any state-changing action in an external service, obtain explicit user authorization for that exact class of action. This includes posting comments, opening or merging pull requests, updating tickets, starting deployments or remote jobs, sending email or chat messages, and changing hosted settings. Read-only external inspection is allowed when needed. A general autonomy instruction does not replace this authorization.

Fan out N parallel cloud workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the cloud concurrency limit.
4. Pick workers from the host's available role catalog and inherit the parent model by default. For an intentional model race, use only model identifiers the host confirms and name each arm up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers concurrently through the host's native delegation interface. Use an isolated worktree for code-writing workers and assign explicit file ownership. Run on the current host unless the user selected another environment and it has the required repository state. If the host cannot fan out concurrently, preserve the same isolation and run the lanes sequentially.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
