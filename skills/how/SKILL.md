# How

## External action boundary

Local, reversible work inside the user-scoped workspace may proceed when the request authorizes the task. Before sending any external message or performing any state-changing action in an external service, obtain explicit user authorization for that exact class of action. This includes posting comments, opening or merging pull requests, updating tickets, starting deployments or remote jobs, sending email or chat messages, and changing hosted settings. Read-only external inspection is allowed when needed. A general autonomy instruction does not replace this authorization.

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

## Step 1. Assess Complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): no explorers. One explainer explores and explains in a single pass. Go to Step 2b.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): spawn parallel explorers first, then hand off to the explainer. Go to Step 2a.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

## Step 2a. Explore (complex questions only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 exploration angles, each a distinct slice of the subsystem. Spawn all explorers concurrently through the host's native read-only exploration role. Inherit the parent model unless the host confirms another available model has a concrete advantage.

Each explorer gets the prompt in `references/explorer-prompt.md` with its angle filled in. Then go to Step 3.

## Step 2b. Direct Explain (simple questions)

Spawn one read-only subagent that explores and explains in one pass. Use the host's native exploration or explanation role and inherit the parent model by default.

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer-findings section. Go to Step 4.

## Step 3. Synthesize (complex questions only)

Once all explorers have returned, spawn one read-only synthesizer through the host's native agent interface. Give it the findings and evidence paths, not an assumed model name.

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` with every explorer's findings filled in.

## Step 4. Present

Present the explainer's output to the user. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output Format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.
