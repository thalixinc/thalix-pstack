# Laziness Protocol

## External action boundary

Local, reversible work inside the user-scoped workspace may proceed when the request authorizes the task. Before sending any external message or performing any state-changing action in an external service, obtain explicit user authorization for that exact class of action. This includes posting comments, opening or merging pull requests, updating tickets, starting deployments or remote jobs, sending email or chat messages, and changing hosted settings. Read-only external inspection is allowed when needed. A general autonomy instruction does not replace this authorization.

Aim for the most result with the least code and complexity.

- **Prefer deletion.** When asked to refactor or improve, look for removals before additions.
- **Maintain a flat call hierarchy.** Avoid deep call chains. A rich interface that hides substantial work is not a deep call chain. If answering a question requires tracing through more than 3 files or layers, flatten it.
- **Consolidate decisions.** Do not repeat the same choice in several places. Put it behind one source of truth and pass the result as a simple flag.
- **Minimize the diff.** Make the smallest change that solves the problem. Fewer lines beat "elegant" boilerplate.
- **Question the threading.** If a task asks you to pass a new signal through types, schemas, pipelines, or similar layers, stop and look for a more direct path.
- **Sweat the small leaks.** Remove tiny pass-throughs, representation leaks, and duplicated choices before they spread. Small leaks compound into permanent coordination costs.

**The test:** If a human developer would find the code exhausting to maintain, it is a bad solution.
